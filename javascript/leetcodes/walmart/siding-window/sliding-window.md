Here's the general technique for the Sliding Window approach:

Define a Window: Identify a portion of the data (like an array or string) to work on, usually represented by two pointers marking the start and end of the window.

Expand the Window: Gradually increase the size of the window (typically moving the end pointer) to include elements until the condition is met.

Shrink the Window: Adjust the start pointer to reduce the window size when necessary (e.g., to maintain constraints or optimize results).

Track Results: Use a variable to keep track of the desired metric (e.g., maximum, minimum, or specific count) as the window slides.

Iterate Efficiently: Process elements only once by adding and removing them from the window, leading to linear time complexity (O(n)).

This technique is commonly used for problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings. Let me know if you'd like an example or further insight!
