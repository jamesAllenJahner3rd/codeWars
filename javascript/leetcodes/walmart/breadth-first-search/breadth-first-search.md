Here’s a breakdown of the general technique for Breadth-First Search (BFS):

Level-by-Level Traversal: Explore all neighbors (or nodes at the same level) before moving deeper into the next level.

Queue-Based Approach: Use a queue data structure to manage the order in which nodes are visited.

Start with Root: Begin at the starting node and mark it as visited.

Enqueue Neighbors: Add all unvisited neighbors of the current node to the queue.

Dequeue and Process: Remove the node from the front of the queue, process it, and repeat the steps until the queue is empty.

Cycle Avoidance: Keep track of visited nodes to avoid reprocessing and potential infinite loops.

This technique is widely used in graph traversal, shortest path finding (in unweighted graphs), and solving maze or puzzle problems. Let me know if you’d like an example or further explanation!
