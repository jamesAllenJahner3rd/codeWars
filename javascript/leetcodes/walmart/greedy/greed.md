Concept: The Greedy Algorithm solves problems by always choosing the best available option at each step, aiming to find an overall optimal solution.

How It Works:

Start with an initial state or empty solution.

At every step, pick the best local choice without looking ahead or revisiting past choices.

Continue until the entire problem is solved.

Key Traits:

Makes decisions step-by-step (locally optimal choices).

Assumes that taking local optima will lead to a global optimum.

Doesnâ€™t backtrack or rethink previous steps.

Works Best When:

The problem has an optimal substructure (a global solution can be built from local solutions).

The problem satisfies the greedy-choice property (choosing locally optimal options leads to a globally optimal solution).

Popular Examples:

Finding the Minimum Spanning Tree in graph algorithms (e.g., Kruskal's, Prim's).

Huffman Encoding for data compression.

The Activity Selection Problem for scheduling tasks efficiently.
